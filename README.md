# PRODIGY_DS_03
TASK-03:
Build a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data. Use a dataset such as the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

To build a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on the Bank Marketing dataset, follow these steps:

Load and Explore the Dataset: Download the dataset and explore its structure.
Preprocess the Data: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features.
Split the Data: Divide the dataset into training and testing sets.
Build and Train the Model: Use a decision tree classifier.
Evaluate the Model: Assess the performance of the model using appropriate metrics.
Tune the Model: Optimize the hyperparameters for better performance.
Here are the key steps to accomplish this task:

1.Data Preparation:
Load the dataset (you can download it from the provided link).
Explore the features (demographic and behavioral data) and the target variable (‘y’ indicating subscription to a term deposit).

2.Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
Handle missing values (luckily, this dataset has no missing values).
Encode categorical variables (e.g., job type, marital status, education) into numeric format.
Split the data into training and testing sets.

3.Decision Tree Classifier:
Initialize a decision tree classifier (you can use libraries like Scikit-learn).
Train the model using the training data.
Evaluate the model’s performance on the testing data (accuracy, precision, recall, etc.).

4.Visualization:
Visualize the decision tree to understand its splits and rules.
Identify important features that contribute to the prediction.
5.Interpretation:
Interpret the decision tree to gain insights into customer behavior.
Understand which features drive the decision-making process.
Remember to install necessary libraries (such as Scikit-learn) using pip install scikit-learn. Once you’ve loaded the dataset, you can follow the steps above to create your decision tree classifier.
